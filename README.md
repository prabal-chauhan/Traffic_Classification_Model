# Traffic_Classification_Model
## Classification:

Classification is the process of predicting the class of given data points. Classes are sometimes called as targets/ labels or categories.

Classification predictive modeling is the task of approximating a mapping **function (f)** from **input variables (X)** to **discrete output variables (y)**.
```
Classification works in three basic steps:

1.  Data cleansing and preparation (pre-processing).

2.  Design and build the CNN network.

3.  Train the model and verify on test / real-life data.

Check-Out 'http://scs.ryerson.ca/~aharley/vis/conv/flat.html' for Classifying Hand-Written numbers using CNN.

### Traffic signs-Classification:

* Classify traffic signs using a *simple convolutional neural network*.
* The CNN learns from the images it is trained on making it an evolving / learning system.
* Training is done on a subset of the repository ('http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset') keeping enough samples for validation and testing.
* During training, care is taken to avoid **over-fitting**. The inner working of the CNN is analyzed to understand activations and how the images convolve as it is processed through the network.
